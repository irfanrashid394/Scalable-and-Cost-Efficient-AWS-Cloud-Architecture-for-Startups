# Scalable and Cost-Efficient AWS Cloud Architecture for Startups

This repository outlines a comprehensive and cost-effective cloud infrastructure blueprint tailored for early-stage startups using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It covers user load estimation, service selection, cost planning, and security considerations with a focus on scalability and free-tier optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- Hybrid cloud setup using **EC2 + Lambda**
- Efficient **S3** storage for static content
- Scalable **DynamoDB** usage for flexible, serverless databases
- Monitoring via **CloudWatch**
- Global performance optimization using **CloudFront**
- Secure service-to-service permissions with **IAM Roles**
- Default **VPC** networking setup

---

## üìà Startup Cost Optimization

All services are planned to fall within AWS Free Tier limits for the first 12 months, ensuring a **near-zero-cost deployment** for:

- 50+ initial users
- 10GB EBS storage
- 2GB monthly S3 usage
- 100,000 monthly Lambda executions
- DynamoDB with 15MB of initial user data
- CloudFront with 1TB transfer and 1M requests free per month

## üß± Architecture Overview

### üñ• EC2 (Web Server)
- `t3.micro` instance handles dynamic requests (user logins, sessions, etc.)
- Burstable performance with upgrade path to `t3.small` or Auto Scaling Group

### ‚öôÔ∏è AWS Lambda
- Handles event-driven, backend tasks:
  - Sending emails
  - Processing forms
  - S3 interactions (e.g. image resizing)

### üóÉ Storage
- **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: 10GB SSD for persistent server data
- **Amazon S3**: For static content (images, PDFs, assets)

### üîç Monitoring & Security
- **CloudWatch** for free-tier system metrics
- **IAM Roles** for minimal-permission access control
- **VPC** (default) for secure network isolation

## üß† Service Comparisons (AWS vs GCP vs Azure)

A detailed analysis of cloud credits, restrictions, and advantages is provided to help choose the right cloud provider. Summary:

| Provider  | Credits (Pre-funded) | Strengths                     | Weaknesses                        |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| AWS       | $1,000               | Compliance, documentation     | Complex pricing, less free usage  |
| Google    | $2,000               | AI/ML, intuitive UI           | Fewer regions, support limitations|
| Azure     | ~$25,000             | Integrated MS services        | No usage caps, risky for startups |

## üß≠ Future Scope

- Add auto-scaling once user traffic increases
- Migrate to RDS if structured relational data becomes dominant
- Enable CloudFront if users grow globally
- Fine-tune IAM roles and custom VPCs as needed
